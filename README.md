> Aspor is a comprehensive web stack for developing fast, modern and reilable web applications (SPA / PWA). The concept is based on a decoupled architecture with an 
> independent OData interface running on an Asp .net service that is consumed by the React frontend application. 
> Backend services are seperated with a Microservice architecture and connected together with Aspor streaming.
